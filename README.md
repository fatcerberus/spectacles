Spectacles: Bruce's Story
=========================

Bruce's Story is the first installment of the three-part Spectacles Saga, a
series of role-playing games following the travails of Scott Starcross as he
attempts to find and defeat the Primus, an exceedingly powerful magic user who
threatens both worlds. According to a prophecy made years before the saga
begins, Scott, the eleventh Littermate, is the only person capable of stopping
the Primus with the aid of the Spectacles, a legendary pair of eyeglasses
granting their wearer magical protection--ostensibly making Scott the chosen
one. But all may not be as it seems...
